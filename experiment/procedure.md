### Procedure

This experiment is about finding the primitive cells or non primitive cells for a given lattice. In theory, a lattice is infinite, but here we have a finite lattice.

<br>
The experiment contains 5 lattices which are :
* Square Planar
* Simple Cubic
* Face Centered Cubic
* Body Centered Cubic
* Hexagonal Packing
 
The first lattice is a planar lattice, meaning it extends in only two dimensions.

#### Finding primitive Cells
Primtive cells can be constructed with ease for simple lattices, usually atoms forming a shape or a polyhedron easily identified. 
<br> <br>
The steps to the experiment are given below
- The interface will contain a canvas in which the different finite lattices in question are shown.
- The interface contains buttons to move to next/previous lattice, a button to select atoms (which is a toggle switch) and a button to check the choice made.
- For a given lattice the user is required to use the `select atoms` interface to select the atoms which constitute primitive cell (if exists) or non primitive cell for that lattice and click `check` button.
- Upon checking user will be greeted with a responce of either `Correct` or `incorrect` depending on the accuracy of the lattice selected.
- Repeat the above two steps for all the 5 lattices presented.

#### Note

Some lattices have been showed with an atom radius that is smaller than the mathematically proven one to help with the visibility of the lattice points to the user.
